### Welcome to my Github page! I just graduated with my M.A. in Economics from The City College of New York!

### Below are three research projects I worked on in R Programming during my M.A. Economics program! I had a lot of fun working on them and learned a lot about coding in R and about being a better researcher! And I would love to do the same for your projects!
